# Arcade animation
An attempt at making an animation to illustrate transient nature of life. Used a track called Whispers Way (Buckethead Pikes #251).
# To view the animation-
Extract the rar file and run Main.py. It'll run flawlessly provided you have arcade installed and a device with decent memory.
