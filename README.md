# Transience Animation
![Preview](Demo/preview.gif)

An attempt at making an animation with the arcade game framework to illustrate transient nature of life.
Used a track called Whispers Way (Buckethead Pikes #251) as background music.
This repo stores all the necessary files and a rar file that can be downloaded and unzipped to watch the animation.
# To view the animation-
Extract the rar file and run Main.py. It'll run flawlessly provided you have Arcade module installed (No other modules are necessary).
