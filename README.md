# Arcade Animation
An attempt at making an animation to illustrate transient nature of life. Used a track called Whispers Way (Buckethead Pikes #251). 
This repo stores all the necessary files and a rar file that can be downloaded and unzipped to watch the animation.
# To watch the animation-
Extract the rar file and run Main.py. It'll run flawlessly provided you have Arcade module installed (No other modules are necessary).
