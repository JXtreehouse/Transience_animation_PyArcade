# Transience Animation
![Preview](Demo/preview.gif)

An attempt at making an animation of one of my favourite anime characters- Itachi.
Made via the arcade framework.
Used a track called Feather by Nujabes as background music.
This repo stores all the necessary files required to view the animation
# To view the animation-
Clone the repo and run Main_long_version.py. It'll run flawlessly provided you have Arcade module installed (No other modules are necessary).
# Acknowledgements
